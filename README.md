# Hands-on Compilers

This repository contains the code for a simple interpreter implemented following the concepts outlined in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by **Robert Nystrom**.

## Overview

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Interpreter** (Jlox): An interpreter that can evaluate and execute programs written in a simple programming language called "Lox".
2. **Compiler** (Clox): A compiler that translates Lox code into bytecode, which is then executed by the interpreter. This isn't finished yet, I just added the code of chapters 14 & 15.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/hands-on-compilers.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory (`Jlox` or `clox`) depending on which part you want to explore.
3. See the code with details and play with it.

## Dependencies

- This project primarily depends on [Java](https://www.java.com/) for implementation.
- No additional external libraries are required.
